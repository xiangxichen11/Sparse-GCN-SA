In this study we 
explore the use of sparse SA mechanisms
with the recent breakthrough model
GCN-SA for learning low-homophily graphs.
We explore related approaches in the literature,
review relevant components of GCN-SA
and sparse SA,
and perform an experiment
on 3 modified GCN-SA model with sparse SA
against 2 baseline models
across 8 datasets.
From our results, 
we observe that
although sparse SA mechanisms maintain the classification
performance of GCN-SA,
it cannot be said that they reduce
empirical runtime.
Further exploration on larger datasets
with more configuration options is required.
